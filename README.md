## Identifying Trends in Proposal Success
I worked with a large engineering firm in Toronto to analyze the data on 3,000+ proposals they had submitted between 2019 and 2024 to identify areas where their win rate excelled or lagged. Their industry is extremely price sensitive and they did not have a line of sight to their competitors' bids, so these results were used to help the company identify areas where they weren't priced competitively.
### Key Project Features 
Messy data, supervised ML, extensive client-facing documentation
### Project Results 
The company's pricing model was fine-tuned to address two key areas where their win rate lagged: properties with 90+ units, and the region of Toronto
